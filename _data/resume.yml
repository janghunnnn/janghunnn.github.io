  summary: |
    저는 현재 렌더링을 연구하고 공부하고 있는 예비 개발자입니다 :)
    
    현재는 성균관대학교에서 컴퓨터그래픽스 전공으로 석사과정을 진행 중에 있습니다. 학부는 성균관대학교 소프트웨어학과를 졸업하였습니다.
    저는 컴퓨터공학을 전공하면서 다른 칙칙한 코딩(제 기준)보다는 렌더링이 너무 재밌기도 하고 어려워서 더 좋았습니다. 특히, 수학적인 사고와 물리적인 현상에 대한 공부를 더 요구해서 딱 제 스타일이였습니다

publications:
  - name: "Potentially Visible Hidden-Volume Rendering for Multi-View Warping"
    publisher: "ACM"

    website: "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3592108"
    summary: "This paper presents the model and rendering algorithm of Potentially Visible Hidden Volumes (PVHVs) for multi-view image warping. PVHVs are 3D volumes that are occluded at a known source view, but potentially visible at novel views. Given a bound of novel views, we define PVHVs using the edges of foreground fragments from the known view and the bound of novel views. PVHVs can be used to batch-test the visibilities of source fragments without iterating individual novel views in multi-fragment rendering, and thereby, cull redundant fragments prior to warping. We realize the model of PVHVs in Depth Peeling (DP). Our Effective Depth Peeling (EDP) can reduce the number of completely hidden fragments, capture important fragments early, and reduce warping cost. We demonstrate the benefit of our PVHVs and EDP in terms of memory, quality, and performance in multi-view warping."
